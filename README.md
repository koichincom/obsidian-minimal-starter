# Obsidian Minimal Starter

This is a minimal starter template for Obsidian. You can download this repository and open it in Obsidian. The philosophy of this setup is to keep your knowledge as "notes" and have a space to edit your file for publishing outside as "posts" as simply as possible. I personally don't like to take notes by typing, and take notes for taking notes, so I only use Obsidian to write about something I research or learn personally.

## Notes

When you create a file in the "notes" folder, a new file named with the date is created with a frontmatter. The frontmatter has two properties, "created at" and "tags". You can put all your tags in the "tags" property to search the file or organize the files in graph view later.

created at: {date:YYYY-MM-DD}<br>
tags:


## Posts

When you create a file in the "posts" folder, a new file with frontmatter is created that I use for my personal blog. You can edit the template file to change however you like.

title: <br>
subtitle: <br>
date: <br>
categories: <br>
layout: <br>
